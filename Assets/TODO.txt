Obstacles
=========

- Different variety of obstacles
	- Cubes
	- Pyramids
	- Small spheres
	- Tall skyscrpaer like cuboids
	- Tunnels
		- Complex and simple
			- Complex could be a long set of rings that form a tunnel
			- Or a long tunnel with turns
			- How would we randomise this without other obstacles going inside it?
				- Certain sections become different after a set distance e.g. reaching distance of 1000 would start spawning tunnels instead of normal obstacles?
	- Long Forward Bridges
		- Although the player would never ride them it would make some nice blend with the shadow
